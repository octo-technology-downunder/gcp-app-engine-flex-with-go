# Google Cloud - App Engine (Flex / Go) - Lab

This lab is part of the [foundations trainings](https://github.com/octo-technology-downunder/octo-au-foundations) in place at [OCTO Technology Australia](http://careers.octo.com.au/).

## Overview of this lab

In this quick lab, we will play with gcloud App Engine.

At the end of the lab you will be able to:
- **deploy a simple Go application** on Google App Engine - Flexible environment (you don't have to understand Go)
- **split traffic** between 2 versions of you app
- do basic operations on your application: **see logs**, **ssh**, debug, view metrics, etc

This lab should take approximately 30 minutes.
You will need to use you own google cloud account.

## What is Google App Engine

Google App Engine (GAE) is a web framework and cloud computing platform for **developing and hosting** web applications in Google Cloud Platform. 
Applications are **sandboxed** and run across **multiple servers**. 
App Engine offers **automatic scaling** for web applications.

You can run your applications in App Engine using the flexible environment or standard environment:
- Using the **flexible environment** means that your application instances run within Docker containers on Google Compute Engine virtual machines.
- Using the **standard environment** means that your application instances run in a sandbox, using the runtime environment of a supported language listed below.

Let's start with a bit of terminology, your applications will use:
- service, basically one independent piece of software you want to deploy. Except if you are deploying micro-services, most of the time your app will have only 1 service.
- version, a deployable version of your app, your service can have several versions
- instance, when a version of a service is deployed, 1 or several instances are created. This is the running instance where your app is hosted.

In this Lab, we will focus on App Engine Flexible environment.


## The Lab - step by step

### 0. Prerequisites

#### Create a project on GCP and activate billing

- Google to the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
- Click on Project List (in the header next to the Google Cloud Platform Logo), the "Create Project"
- Give it a "Name", select a billing account, then use the "Create" button

For more information about this prerequisite step please refer to the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).

#### Install and configure Google Cloud SDK 

- Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/downloads-interactive) on your machine
- Configure you SDK with you gcloud account, select a project with the command line `gcloud init`

### 1. Prepare your application

#### Get the source code

- git clone this repository on you machine
- have a look to the helloworld.go file, it is a simple Go app doing an _Hello World_
- update the string `Hello mate, if you like this lab, please give me a star :)` by any other string, it could be `Hello World`

#### Make you local project ready for GCP

GCP is using a yaml configuration file to know how to deploy your application, let's create it.

Create an **app.yaml** file to describe your application, for that you can use the existing **app.yaml.template** as an example.

Only 2 lines required are:
- `env: flex`, type of Google App Engine (GAE) project, GCP provided 2 type of environment: [Flexible or Standard](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/the-appengine-environments).
- `runtime: go`, to tell GAE which runtime do you want to use.

I would also recommend setting the `service: YOUR_APP_NAME`, if not your application will be deployed in the default one (hope you are alone on your project if it is the case).

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/configuring-your-app-with-app-yaml) to see all available options you could put in this file.

### 2. Deploy your application

#### Deploy you have using your terminal

To do so, just use this simple command line in you shell: `gcloud app deploy`.

It will ask you a few questions like in which region you do want to deploy the app. 
Then take a coffee, it could take up to 10 minutes for the app to be created.

#### Check the results in the google cloud online console

##### Notice the Docker image in the registry (Menu > Container Registry)

GCP App Engine Flexible environment is using Docker under the hood to deploy your application. You can see the built image in the registry.


##### Look at the build logs from the online console (Menu > Cloud Build > History)

The build process could fail for many reason: your app is broken, the app.yaml file is not valid...
To take a look to the logs of the build process, go the the GCP Cloud Build service.

##### Notice the created Service  with 1 version (Menu > App Engine > Service)

A service is a kind of application.
You should be able to see the created Service from the GCP console with the name you put in the app.yaml file.


From here, you can:
- see the number of version you service have (should be 1 at this stage)
- access application logs from the "Tool" menu

Then click on "Versions"

##### Notice the Version: status, traffic allocation, #instances  (Menu > App Engine > Version >> select your service)

This screen list all versions available for your service. Basically, 1 version is created each time you deploy.
If you can't find your version, use the drop-down at the top to select the good service.

When your application is deployed, you should be able to see:
- Status -> Serving
- Traffic Allocation to 100%
- Instances 1 (or more according to your configuration)
- You can also take a look to the config file GCP linked to this version and look at the logs of your application.

You can also check the logs from your terminal: `gcloud app logs tail -s YOUR_APP_NAME`

This screen is important, this is where you can control the traffic of your app: Stop a version, Start, Migrate or split traffic between several versions. 

##### Find Instances (Menu > App Engine > Instances >> select your service)

If your version is in serving state (started), 1 or more instances will be linked to it.
This screen allows you do see those instances, ssh on them

##### And then, view your deployed app

Click on the service name from the Service list or use the command `gcloud app browse -s YOUR_APP_NAME`

### 3. Create a 2nd version of your application

#### Update the message served by your application

Update the message served your helloworld.go file with something else (ie, from "Hello World" (set in pre-requisites) to "GAE is as simple as that")

#### Redeploy your app

Run the same command that previously: `gcloud app deploy`

##### Notice this 2nd version on the online console (Menu > App Engine > Version >> select your service)

Redeploying an application will create a new "Version" of it, the process still takes a bit of time but at the end of it you will be able to see your new version listed on the "Version" screen.

##### Test your second version

Exactly as before, if it is not ready within 2 minutes, wait a bit more :)
`gcloud app browse -s go-YOUR_APP_NAME`

### 4. Split traffic between those 2 versions

To do so, go the Versions (Menu > App Engine > Version >> select your service), then:
- start the previous version to have 2 versions with status “Serving”
- then select those 2 versions the click “Split Traffic button”
- select "Random" (easier to test that IP based), then set traffic allocation to 50% 50%

<img src="./static/split.png" width="800" />

To test if it works:
- go back to the version list and notice the traffic allocation has been updated.
- then take another coffee or wait for 5 to 10 minutes. If you do prefer tea, sorry for you it won't work :)
- open your service in the browser and refresh many times
- After several refreshes, you should see 2 different messages (1 by version)
If 1 of those fails (503) => wait more...

That was easy! You made it, congrats!
